Write a program to print all the locations at which a particular element (taken as input) is found in a list and also print the total number of times it occurs in the list. The location starts from 1.

 

For example, if there are 4 elements in the array:

 

5

6

5

7

 

If the element to search is 5 then the output will be:

 

5 is present at location 1

5 is present at location 3

5 is present 2 times in the array.

Question text
Given two lists A and B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.

We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B at index j.

These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.

For example, given

Input

5

12 28 46 32 50

50 12 32 46 28

Output

1 4 3 2 0

Explanation

A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]

B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]

We should return

[1, 4, 3, 2, 0]

as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1], and P[1] = 4 because the 1st element of A appears at B[4], and so on.

Note:

A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].
A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].

Answer:

#mapping
n=int(input())
a=input()
b=input()
c=a.split()
d=b.split()
l=list()
for i in range(0,len(c)):
    for j in range(0,len(d)):
        if c[i]==d[j]:
            l.append(j)
for i in l:
    print(i,end=' ')

Question text
Determine the factors of a number (i.e., all positive integer values that evenly divide into a number) and then return the pth element of the list, sorted ascending. If there is no pth element, return 0.

Example

n = 20

p = 3

The factors of 20 in ascending order are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}. Using 1-based indexing, if p = 3, then 4 is returned. If p > 6, 0 would be returned.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 1015

1 ≤ p ≤ 109

The first line contains an integer n, the number to factor.

The second line contains an integer p, the 1-based index of the factor to return.

Question 10

Given an array of numbers, find the index of the smallest array element (the pivot), for which the sums of all elements to the left and to the right are equal. The array may not be reordered.

Example

arr=[1,2,3,4,6]

·         the sum of the first three elements, 1+2+3=6. The value of the last element is 6.

·         Using zero based indexing, arr[3]=4 is the pivot between the two subarrays.

·         The index of the pivot is 3.

Constraints
